# ComparingAppliedMathVsStatisticsAlgos
I compared various Applied Math algorithms like SVD, SOR for solving least squares problems with regularization approaches 
used in machine learning like Lasso or Ridge in terms of system time and accuracy.
This was when our dataset is sparse (n>p) and has full column rank. In the case of rank deficient matrix, 
SVD as well as regularization approaches like Lasso will give good results.
